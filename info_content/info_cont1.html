New South Wales lies on the east coast of Australia, between Queensland and Victoria. Sydney is Australia’s premier gateway, the State capital and Australia’s largest city, and is easily reached by frequent flights from Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania. NSW is also well serviced by a network of regional airlines, trains, buses and coach services. Sydney is the biggest, oldest and most cosmopolitan city in Australia - and one of the most vibrant and exciting cities on earth. Its sparkling harbour, dazzling beaches and sunny, Mediterranean climate are matched by an array of splendid museums and galleries, spirited nightlife, relaxed lifestyle and rich architectural heritage. Sydney is also one of the most culturally diverse cities on earth. With a population of 4.34 million (June 2007), the accents of Asia, Europe and the Middle East intermingle on its streets, restaurants and festival calendar. The surrounding regions within three hours’ drive from Sydney offer a world of astonishing natural attractions - wine regions, beaches, World Heritage national parks and spectacular coastal and country scenery. The Snowy Mountains is an inspiring destination for winter sports and summer hiking. Lord Howe Island a World Heritage-listed island, is a timeless, natural paradise. Quintessentially Australian settlements founded by gold miners, graziers and farmers and now attracting lovers of food and history anchor the Heart of Country, stretching across the sunny western plains from north to south. Farthest west is the Outback, rich with Aboriginal heritage and the magic of the desert. The North Coast provides a taste of classic Aussie surf culture, while the South Coast has more than 30 national parks, marine parks and reserves. There are many distinguished museums, libraries, galleries, performing arts companies and venues in New South Wales, providing a focal point for cultural activities. With a backdrop of stunning landscapes on offer, combined with the range of lifestyles that New South Wales nurtures, it's not surprising that so many have chosen to call this place home. From the bustling, modern city of Sydney with its magnificent harbour, coastline and National Park fringe, through to the picturesque heritage, agricultural and produce towns stretching inland towards the sparse, colourful desert region, there's truly something on offer for everyone. Just ask any local, who will, in the spirit of friendly rivalry with closest neighbours, proudly point out why their niche in New South Wales is the only place to be.
