the Aboriginal peoples</a>, have lived in the area for more than 45,000 years 
and many reminders of this period still exists today. In Sydney and the 
surrounding regions alone there are more than 2,000 Aboriginal rock engraving 
sites and many of Sydney's suburbs have Aboriginal names such as Woolloomooloo, 
Parramatta and Yagoona.<br>

Captain James Cook</a> sailed into what is now called Botany Bay. Cook later 
claimed a section of Australia's East Coast for Great Britain under the name of 
New South Wales. The transportation of convicts which followed resulted in a 
gritty, colourful history that can be seen around Sydney City's The Rocks 
suburb.&nbsp; Sydney's population reached 1 million in 1925 and now has over 4.5 
million people. The

east coast of Australia, between Queensland and Victoria.
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.visitnsw.com/zone/Sydney.aspx">
Sydney</a> is Australia's premier gateway, the State capital and Australia's 
largest city, and is easily reached by
<a style="color: blue; text-decoration: underline; text-underline: single" href="http://www.visitnsw.com/Travelling_to_Sydney_and_NSW_p2830.aspx">
frequent flights</a> from Asia, Europe, North America and Oceania. NSW is also 
well serviced by a network of regional airlines, trains, buses and coach

<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family:Arial">&nbsp;The two major landmarks of 
Sydney's skyline --the Sydney Harbour Bridge, opened in 1932 and in 1973 Queen 
Elizabeth II opened the Sydney Opera House which was added to the World Heritage 
List in 2007.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">Regions of New South Wales</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">The surrounding regions within three hours 
drive from Sydney offer a world of astonishing natural attractions - wine 
regions, beaches, World Heritage national parks and spectacular coastal and 
country scenery.&nbsp; </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">The Snowy Mountains is an inspiring 
destination for winter sports and summer hiking. &nbsp;Lord Howe Island a World 
Heritage-listed island, is a timeless, natural paradise.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Quintessentially Australian settlements 
founded by gold miners, graziers and farmers and now attracting lovers of food 
and history anchor the Heart of Country, stretching across the sunny western 
plains from north to south. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Farthest west is the Outback, rich with 
Aboriginal heritage and the magic of the desert. The North Coast provides a 
taste of classic Aussie surf culture, while the South Coast has more than 30 
national parks, marine parks and reserves.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">Culture in NSW</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">There are many distinguished museums, 
libraries, galleries, performing arts companies and venues in New South Wales, 
providing a focal point for cultural activities. Beyond the large institutions 
is a thriving network of independent locally-run spaces that encourage regional 
or young and emerging artists. Similarly, many actors and musicians get their 
start in the local theatres and bars, or short film and television productions, 
before going on to achieve international acclaim. Festivals are a major 
highlight, with plenty of film festivals staggered throughout the year as well 
as vibrant music and arts festivals in the summer time.</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family:Arial;
  color:red">Sydney</span><span style="font-family:Arial;
color:red">&nbsp;</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Sydney is the biggest, oldest and most 
cosmopolitan city in Australia - and one of the most vibrant and exciting cities 
on earth. Its sparkling harbour, dazzling beaches and sunny, Mediterranean 
climate are matched by an array of splendid museums and galleries, spirited 
nightlife, relaxed lifestyle and rich architectural heritage.</span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Sydney is also one of the most culturally 
diverse cities on earth. With a population of 4.34 million (June 2007), the 
accents of Asia, Europe and the Middle East intermingle on its streets, 
restaurants and festival calendar.&nbsp;</span></p>
<h2><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">Places in Sydney</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">With a backdrop of stunning landscapes on 
offer, combined with the range of lifestyles that New South Wales nurtures, it's 
not surprising that so many have chosen to call this place home. From the 
bustling, modern city of Sydney with its magnificent harbour, coastline and 
National Park fringe, through to the picturesque heritage, agricultural and 
produce towns stretching inland towards the sparse, colourful desert region, 
there's truly something on offer for everyone. Just ask any local, who will, in 
the spirit of friendly rivalry with closest neighbours, proudly point out why 
their niche in New South Wales is the only place to be. </span></p>

<h2><span style="font-family:Arial;color:red">Climate</span></h2>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Sydney has a temperate climate with warm 
summers and cool winters, and rainfall spread throughout the year. The weather 
is moderated by proximity to the ocean, and more extreme temperatures are 
recorded in the inland western suburbs.<br>

in), falling on an average 138 days a year. Snowfall was last reported in the 
Sydney City area in 1836<br>
Bondi Beach in Sydney's east. Sydney's warm weather in summer makes its beaches 
very popular. The city is not affected by cyclones. The El Nino Southern 
Oscillation plays an important role in determining Sydney's weather patterns: 
drought and bushfire on the one hand, and storms and flooding on the other, 
associated with the opposite phases of the oscillation. </span></p>
<p><span style="font-family:Arial">Many areas of the city bordering bushland 
have experienced bushfires, notably in 1994 and 2001/02 ----- these tend to 
occur during the spring and summer. The city is also prone to severe hail storms 
and wind storms and flash flooding from rain caused by East Coast Lows (a low 
pressure depression which can bring significant damage by heavy rain, cyclonic 
winds and huge swells).<br>
&nbsp;</span></p>

temperatures range from 16*C in Winter to 26*C in Summer.&nbsp; Average relative 
humidity varies from 60% to 71%.&nbsp;<br>
